                    style="color: black; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;column-count: 3;font-size: 17px;column-rule-style:dotted;">
                    The University of Kurdistan (UOK) commenced its activities as the Higher College of Sanandaj, an
                    affiliate of Tarbiat Moallem (Teacher Training Institute), Tehran in the academic year 1974-1975.
                    Its first intake of students was in the field of Mathematics Teacher Training. In the following
                    academic year, the college became an off campus faculty of Kermanshah’s Razi University and was
                    thereafter named the Sanandaj Faculty of Teacher Training.
                    In addition to admitting students in Mathematics Teacher Training, it began to accept students in
                    Chemistry and English. By expanding its pedagogical activities and conducting research in a wide
                    variety of fields, this teacher training unit was granted university status by the Ministry of
                    Higher Education and Culture in 1991. Henceforth it became known as the University of Kurdistan.
                    Since then a great range of courses at various levels have been added to the university’s graduate
                    and postgraduate programme lists including a postdoctoral course offered by the Department of
                    Chemistry.
                    Currently, University of Kurdistan has nearly 9000 students, of which nearly 25 per cent are
                    postgraduate students. University of Kurdistan has 8 faculties and 51 departments offering 172
                    undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Moreover, UOK employs approximately 350 full-time academic
                    faculty members with over 95 per cent having Assistant Professorship or above grading (14 Full
                    Professors and 64 Associate Professors).In addition, many part-time teaching staff are employed and
                    the number of administrative staff totals 202.</br> University of Kurdistan has an active research
                    community with internationally recognized academic staff who have published 210 ISI articles in the
                    past year, 180 of which have Q1 and Q2 JCR ranking. In addition, academic staff have published 250
                    scientific research papers in national journals and 400 academic papers have been presented at
                    national and international conferences. Currently, the university has 6 research institutes and 5
                    academic journals and has its own publishing press with many yearly publications. Moreover, UOK has
                    plentiful research and teaching laboratories to aid students and staff at all faculties.
                    UOK has a non-centralized administrative structure managed by the Board of Trustees (which has the
                    highest position in the University and overlooks future educational expansion, financial projections
                    and other major plans of the University), the Chancellor, 5 Vice Chancellors (Vice Chancellors of
                    Educational Affairs, Research Affairs, Student Affairs, Financial Affairs and Cultural And Social

                <h1>The City Of Sanandaj</h1>
                <p
                    style="color: black; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;column-count: 2;font-size: 20px;column-rule-style:dotted;">
                    The city of Sanandaj is the capital of Kurdistan Province and 512 kilometers west of Tehran. It is
                    geographically located almost in the center of the province so that except for the cities of Saqez
                    and Baneh, it has borders with the other cities in the province. Sanandaj has a population of
                    419,750 as per the last census taken in 2005 and is thus the province’s most populous city. It is
                    considered to be one of the most beautiful cities in Iran because of its scenic views and
                    topography. The city is surrounded by mountains and hills, and has a mountainous climate where
                    summers are relatively mild and winters cold. Some of these hills, such as Tapeh Tooshnawzar, Tapeh
                    Roosi and Tapeh Sharaf-al-mulk, are of religious and historical importance. Two well-known mountain
                    landmarks in the city are Abidar and Kochek Rash (black stone) which are situated at opposing ends
                    of the city.
                    The name Sanandaj is an Arabicized form of the compound word “Sna dezh” and the native Kurdish
                    people of the city call the city “Sna”. Although many definitions exist for the term “Sna”, in the
                    Avesta (primary collection of religious texts of Zoroastrianism)it is defined as “hawk” or “eagle”
                    and the word “dezh” means fort.

                            was established in 1991 as the second faculty of the University of Kurdistan, but began its
                            teaching activities much earlier in 1976 by accepting students majoring in English language
                            teacher training and later establishing 14 departments. The Faculty of Literature and
                            Foreign Languages currently has 4 departments offering 5 undergraduate programmes, 5
